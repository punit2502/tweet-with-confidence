# Tweet with Confidence

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/punit2502/tweet-with-confidence.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Every time this happens to me: Create & Post Tweet, Find a small mistake, Copy & Delete Tweet, Repost with mistake removed. So I made a small tool [TWC](https://tweet-with-confidence.netlify.com) where we write our tweet, press next and it will add four random characters to our tweet then We have to find the random characters inserted and input it in the text box below. This way we read our tweet character by character and can easily spot any mistake.
